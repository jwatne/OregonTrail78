## General Information
Sometime around 1980, I attended a computer programming summer school course, programming in BASIC
on timeshare computers linked via analog couplers to the TIES system. One day, I typed the command
to print the most recently loaded program, which I mistakenly thought was one of those consisting
of a couple dozen lines that I would write for the course. Instead, I got page after page of the
complete BASIC source code of the 1978 version of 
[Oregon Trail](https://mncomputinghistory.com/oregon-trail-computer-game/). This was essentially
the same as 
[the version appearing in the May 1978 issue of "Creative Computing" magazine](https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1978-05/page/n139/mode/2up).

Rather than waste it,
I took it home, and spent several hours doing my first port of the code - to ATARI BASIC, typing
it in on the membrane keyboard of my Atari 400 computer. I kept the printout ever since.

I rediscovered the printout when cleaning out my basement a few weeks ago, and decided to try a
new port of the code, to Java. The code is a simple command line Java application. While I have
broken the single basic file into multiple objects, used more descriptive variable names, and 
modified the code in other ways to use more modern coding practices not supported by the computer
languages available when the original program was written, I have tried to keep the end user
experience as identical as possible. This includes the same use of random numbers, writing all
text in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, and doing non-case-sensitive text comparisons of what the user
enters to the word to be typed when "shooting".
